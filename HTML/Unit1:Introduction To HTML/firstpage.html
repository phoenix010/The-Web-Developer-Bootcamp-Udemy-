	<p>A <strong>paragraph</strong> is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. <em>Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences</em>. There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.</p>
	<p>In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.</p>
